Construction Security Page 

Iâ€™m a web designer for BrickHouse Security. This is a Construction Security page designed to market to the construction security industry. The solutions on this page are meant to increse SEO as well as help our Construction Security B2B clients select the right tool for the job, when it comes to protecting construction equiptment and the site.

This is a web page that was designed  to be inserted into a an ecommcerce CMS (MarketLive). I designed the page in Adobe Photoshop and coded it using HTML5 and CSS. The purpose of this page is to depict my knowledge of web design. This is something one would not fork, as this is just for show. Thanks for looking, hope you like my work. 

Cheerse,

Stan
